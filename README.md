# Jeena's zines
Zines (pronounced â€œzeens") are small publications that come in the form of mini pamphlets or magazines! 

This is a repository of zines I created to:
- help *me* understand unfamiliar topics better. Teaching someone else is often the best way to learn something!
- help others understand certain topics better. Since a zine cannot contain too much information, often it will hold just the essence of a topic, which is often helpful for learning a new topic!

## How to print and fold
Unless specified in the zine, follow the instructions here! https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Zine#Folding-and-Cutting-the-Zine_sub
